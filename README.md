# What the program does.
It allows a single user(admin), to answer questions(polls) for everyone within his group.
In this way a single user(admin) can answer everybody polls.
# How the code works?
For this code to work, you will need an admin(main person), the admin joins a server and creates his own group. There can be only one admin and there's no limit on users under one admin.
The user, joins the same server as admin, and joins the group, created by the admin.
Whenever a question appears, the code automatically detects the question, and gives admin the option to select the correct answer. The answer which the admin selects gets selected for every user automatically.
In this way a single person(admin) can answer, all the questions.

# Requirements
